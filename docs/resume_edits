On the Education section:

I would add the month along with the year 2021.

Related experience:

At the top of your resume you have skills listed but you don't mention these skills in your job experience. 
I would say "Developed semesterly assessment schedule for 15 student support programs USING (python, R, git, etc).

Highlight your technical skills by demostrating the technology in the things you've done.

The first word of the sentence are usually key words that resume algorithmns go through and cross match with key words in job description. In this case there's no match so what 
I would do is make sure that the leading key words are unique. I would maybe consider changing using the word "Designed" twice in the "Research and Assesment Team Lead" portion. 
That's your perogative however.

As it states in your resume, you need to update the Good2go project for the Data Science Consulting Team. I am excited to see the updates!

For the services and work history I would maybe list skills if they pertain to data. Was there data entry? Project management? It might tie in how you stated you like to work
with people and you could highlight that!

Hopefully these help!
